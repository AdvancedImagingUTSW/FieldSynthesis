# FieldSynthesis

## Abstract

We introduce Field Synthesis, a theorem and method that can be used to synthesize any scanned or dithered light-sheet, including those used in lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM), from an incoherent superposition of one-dimensional intensity distributions. Compared to LLSM, this user-friendly and modular approach offers a simplified optical design, higher light-throughput and simultaneous multicolor illumination. Further, Field Synthesis achieves lower rates of photobleaching than light-sheets generated by lateral beam scanning.

## Proof

The canonical proof can be found in the supplemental information of the manuscript. Here we also have also included 
[an illustrated proof for the Field Synthesis Theorem in the form of a MATLAB Live Script](https://mkitti.github.io/FieldSynthesis/FieldSynthesis/FieldSynthesisProofIllustration.html).

A more [general Field Synthesis Theorem proof for the an arbitrary, non-ideal line profile](https://mkitti.github.io/FieldSynthesis/FieldSynthesis/FieldSynthesisProofIllustrationNonIdeal.html) is now also available.

## Code

### FieldSynthesisTheorem.m

   Small program to illustrate a new Field Synthesis Theorem.

   In essence it says that the projection of the absolute modulus of a
   complex field is the same as when one takes a sliding window in the
   Fourier domain, makes an inverse FFT of each slice, take the absolute
   modulus of that and sum it up while moving the window through the
   spectrum.  This has important applications for scanned light-sheets and
   how to generate them.

   #### INPUT
   * efield - electric field at the focal plane, may be real or complex
            valued
   
   #### OUTPUT
   * efield - electric field at the focal plane
   * slice  - intensity of illumination pattern by field synthesis
   * smear  - intensity of illumination pattern by dithering
   * Q      - Fourier transform of individual line scan without phasing,a=10

### FieldSynthesisInteractive.m

FieldSynthesisInteractive Create an interactive line scan demonstration of
field synthesis

 #### INPUT
 * mask - mask at the pupil, which is the Fourier transform of electrical
        field at the focal plane. zeroth frequency should be in the
        middle. ifftshift will be applied for calcualtions.
 * doshift - if true, shift the Fourier transform of the mask so the first
           pixel is in the center of the image rather than the upper left
 * lineProfile  -  line profile for the scan in the pupil mask
                 EITHER:
                 1) 0 for a delta function line scan
                 2) a positive double value indicating the sigma of the
                      gaussianLine in pixels
                 3) a line profile vector the same width as mask. The main
                    peak is expected to be in the center and ifftshift
                    will be applied

 #### OUTPUT
 * hfig - handle for the display figure

 #### INTERACTIVE
 * The button in the lower left plays / pauses the movie.
 * The arrow buttons on the slider will move the scan by one column.
 * Clicking on the trough of the slider will move the scan by five columns.
 * The button in the lower right labeled R will reset the cumulative view.

 #### DISPLAY
 The display consists of 6 panels
 1 2 3
 4 5 6
 1. The pupil mask, |\hat{F}|^2 in log scale
 2. The object domain, |F|^2, scanning left to right
    Line plot indicates beam intensity
 3. Dithered, averaged intensity. Cumulative sum of display #2
 4. Display of the real component of the electric field of an insteaneous
    scan, Real{T_a}
 5. Instaneous scan intensity, |T_a|^2
 6. Cumulative scan intensity of display #5
