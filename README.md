# FieldSynthesis

## Abstract

We introduce Field Synthesis, a theorem that can be used to synthesize any scanned or dithered light-sheet, including those used in lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM), from an incoherent superposition of one-dimensional intensity distributions. This user-friendly and modular approach offers a drastically simplified optical design, higher light-throughput, simultaneous multicolor illumination, and a 100% spatial duty cycle, thereby providing uncompromised biological imaging with decreased rates of photobleaching.

### FieldSynthesisTheorem.m

   Small program to illustrate a new Field Synthesis Theorem.

   In essence it says that the projection of the absolute modulus of a
   complex field is the same as when one takes a sliding window in the
   Fourier domain, makes an inverse FFT of each slice, take the absolute
   modulus of that and sum it up while moving the window through the
   spectrum.  This has important applications for scanned light-sheets and
   how to generate them.

   #### INPUT
   * efield - electric field at the focal plane, may be real or complex
            valued
   
   #### OUTPUT
   * efield - electric field at the focal plane
   * slice  - intensity of illumination pattern by field synthesis
   * smear  - intensity of illumination pattern by dithering
   * Q      - Fourier transform of individual line scan without phasing,a=10
   * T      - Fourier transform of individual line scan with phasing,a=10

### FieldSynthesisInteractive.m

FieldSynthesisInteractive Create an interactive line scan demonstration of
field synthesis

 #### INPUT
 * mask - mask at the pupil, which is the Fourier transform of electrical
        field at the focal plane
 * doshift - if true, shift the Fourier transform of the mask so the first
           pixel is in the center of the image rather than the upper left

 #### OUTPUT
 * hfig - handle for the display figure

 #### INTERACTIVE
 * The button in the lower left plays / pauses the movie.
 * The arrow buttons on the slider will move the scan by one column.
 * Clicking on the trough of the slider will move the scan by five columns.
 * The button in the lower right labeled R will reset the cumulative view.

### createAnnulus.m

 #### INPUT (all optional)
 * n - size of the annular mask as a scalar, or vector with coordinates
 * r - radius of the annulus in pixels
 * w - width of the annulus in pixels

 #### OUTPUT
 * annulus - n x n matrix with the annulus marked with ones

 #### USAGE
```matlab
 figure;
 imshow(createAnnulus(256,32,4),[]);
```

![Basic annulus in 256x256 image with radius 32 and width 4](images/createAnnulus_basic.png)

 Create Bessel beam 2D profile
```matlab
 figure;
 imshow(log(abs(fftshift(ifft2(ifftshift(createAnnulus)))).^2+1),[]);
 colormap(gca,hot);
 caxis([0 6e-4]);
```
