# FieldSynthesis

## Abstract

We introduce Field Synthesis, a theorem that can be used to synthesize any scanned or dithered light-sheet, including those used in lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM), from an incoherent superposition of one-dimensional intensity distributions. This user-friendly and modular approach offers a drastically simplified optical design, higher light-throughput, simultaneous multicolor illumination, and a 100% spatial duty cycle, thereby providing uncompromised biological imaging with decreased rates of photobleaching.
